Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ in this article I want to focus mainly on **the concept** and **the mental model** behind a theme. We are going to talk about what is, what it is used for, pros and cons, and when we should use it so let's start with the first question:

<br />

## What's a theme?

We can think about a theme as our **source of truth of styles**, a contract in which we define all the visual and [atomic](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms) properties that will determine the **look and feel** of our user interface (colors, shadows, typography, etc).

Having a theme model helps us to have a **visual consistency** throughout our application and **more control over the styles**. Let's see a basic example of what a theme implementation would look like in a `.jsx` file (please, don't do this at home, it's just an example):

<CH.Code>

```javascript theme.js
export const theme = {
	colors: {
		primary: '#cdb4db',
		secondary: '#ffc8dd',
		acent: '#a2d2ff',
	},
	borders: {
		sm: 4,
		md: 8,
	},
}
```

```javascript Button.jsx
import { theme } from './theme'

const Button = () => (
	<button style={{ backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary, borderRadius: theme.borders.md }}>Hello!</button>
)
```

</CH.Code>

Now, if we wanted to update the borders or the colors of our application, we would only have to update our theme and we would have that update across the whole application.

## Why It's important a theme?

More and more complex user interfaces are being built and as an application grows, it can be a challenge **to maintain** or **evolve** its styles. That is where themes come in to offer us:

1. **Scalability:** we can add new parameters or changes in an instant, throughout the application.

2. **Flexibility:** having a UI based on themes, we can have more than one theme, for more than one need.

3. **Consistency:** unified standards and criteria throughout the application. No more loose definitions.

4. **Maintainability:** updates of colors, scales and changes in one place.

#### Disadvantages **of having a theme**

Although the benefits can be many, let's remember that **everything has its cost** and implementing a theme is no exception because it can represent a **cost of time** and in some cases, a challenge. These are some of the disadvantages that we will have to deal with:

**Time:** In a real world scenario with an interdisciplinary team, a theme requires coordination with the design team and sometimes the creation of a design system or ui kit (depending on the needs of the product). And both design, coordination and then development can take a vital time in delivering value to a product or its business model. \*(although, once we have the theme, then changes or updates to our ui are incredibly fast, I will take into account the initial time cost of implementation).

**Complexity:** Depending on the need of the product or the motivation of the team, we will need to stop and think about the architecture of our user interface and come up with the most suitable solution. Think about a scalable structure.

**Integration of technologies:** If we are not using any framework-ui in our application, we should consider integrating some tool, because if we need a theme a little more complex than the definitions provided by CSS Cuesotm properties or updates in a "programmatic" way then we will need some help. Some options are the CSS in JS styling ways, however we must be very careful because many options come with a performance cost at runtime, however there are alternatives such as Vanilla Extract or Panda-CSS that already solve this aspect.

## When shoul I use a theme?

Just as everything has its use case, the theme model is no exception. Although the most common motivation for incorporating a theme (at least with CSS properties), is to implement a "white or dark mode", here are some reasons to know if you need to implement a more complex theme in your application:

1. If your application has a medium/large volume of UI components and depends a lot on its look and feel.
2. If your application needs to update periodically or by events/seasons its identity.
3. If you are creating a component library based on some design system (especially this point).
4. If your users can change and customize color preferences or appearance of your application.

#### When it would not be necessary to implement a theme?

If your application has a small volume of UI components or a simple user interface or even if you are developing a prototype/demo.

_While the points mentioned above can help us make a decision on whether or not to include a theme in our UI architecture, they are not absolute reasons. It will depend a lot on the needs of your application, its size, or if you are already using an ui framework (tailwind-css, material-ui, etc)._

## Different flavours

Of course it is not the same to create a theme for an entire design system, than to use a theme model in a small/medium application to standardize the measures and primitive units of your application. So I would like to make a distinction between two types of models:

### Partial Themes, based on CSS Custom Properties

It's hard to talk about themes without mentioning [CSS custom properties. They are incredibly useful but have their limitations with what we can declare. They still can't cover all the needs involved in complex theming throughout an application. However for the most general cases, they usually cover the needs. Here you can see a basic theme model with CSS properties (I'm sure you are familiar with it):

<CH.Code>

```css styles.css
:root {
	--background-color: #fff;
	--background-alternative-color: #f1faee;
	--color-primary: #cdb4db;
	--color-secondary: #ffc8dd;
	--color-acent: #a2d2ff;

	--font-heading: Georgia, serif;
	--font-body: Inter, system-ui;
	--font-size-xs: 8px;
	--font-size-sm: 12px;
	--font-size-md: 14px;
	--font-size-lg: 18px;
}
```

</CH.Code>

##### With CSS variables we can:

- Standardize colors, shadows and gradients.
- Standardize fonts (with their scales and variants).
- Standardize layout measures.
- Add progressive enhancements or "fallbacks" to a property.
- Create schemes for a "native" dark and light mode.

### Themes basados en CSS in JS

_Vanilla Extract | Panda CSS | TypeStyle | Styled Components_

## What else should I know?

It is important to mention that in a **"real world"** and **interdisciplinary environment**, in order to successfully implement a theme in our application, there must be a **coordination and preparation with the design team**. They are the ones in charge of the look and feel of the application. Together with them, we will be able to define **the scope** and **complexity** of the theme for our UI architecture.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, implementing a theme in a user interface can be an **expensive** task that requires **coordination**, time and careful **consideration of the UI architecture**. However the benefits we gain often outweigh the disadvantages by **ensuring visual consistency**, providing scalability, flexibility and maintainability of styles in our application.

**Let's recall the use case:** _if your application has a large volume of visual components or if your application needs to update its identity periodically or programmatically due to events or user preferences._

##### So, what can we learn about themes?

Although we will not always need to implement a theme using CSS in JS technologies, we can strive for **standardized styles** and take advantage of themes even without their explicit implementation (for example the importance of using CSS Custom Propperties or the composition of atomic components over specific style definitions):

<CH.Code>

```css
/* better this */
.btn {
	backgorund-color: var(--color-primary);
	border-radius: var(--border-sm);
}

/* over this */
.btn {
	backgorund-color: #cdb4db;
	border-radius: 8px;
}
```

</CH.Code>

<CH.Code>

```javascript
/* better this */
const Button = () => (
	<button style={{ backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary, borderRadius: theme.borders.md }}>Hello!</button>
)

/* over this */
const Button = () => <button style={{ backgroundColor: '#cdb4db', borderRadius: '12px' }}>Hello!</button>
```

</CH.Code>
